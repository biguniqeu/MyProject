# Real-time-face-recognition-audo-attendance-system
This is our final year project. We were a team of four. My role in this project was to build backend part using Machine Learning Algorithm. We have used OpenCV to make this project possible. We have used Haarcascade algorithm in its core working. My other team members handle GUI parts and some backend part as well. 
Anyone willing to use this project can definitely use in their college/school project.
